Select+
=======

*A JQuery UI-enabled single- and multi-select widget*

Select+ is being re-organized. I've used it (successfully) in a couple of my
work projects now and have learned some things about what it can and cannot do.
In other words, I have thoughts on how to make it better, especially in light
of the fairly recent addition of the selectmenu control on core JQuery UI.

The source as it stands is the same as was in the old project, except that I
reformatted some of the comments. I will be filling out the build process
shortly so that a ready-to-use package is available, and then I will be
implementing tests, refactoring, writing documentation, and adding some of the 
new features I've come up with over the last few months.
