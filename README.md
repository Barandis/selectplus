Select+
=======

*A JQuery UI-enabled single- and multi-select widget*

Select+ is being re-organized. I've used it (successfully) in a couple of my
work projects now and have learned some things about what it can and cannot do.
In other words, I have thoughts on how to make it better, especially in light
of the fairly recent addition of the selectmenu control on core JQuery UI.

The source as it stands is the same as was in the old project, except that I
reformatted some of the comments. The build is now being done with
Gulp/Browserify, so there's a bit of unfamiliar boilerplate code for the latter
at the beginning, but otherwise it's identical.

Over the next few days I'll be adding documentation and adding a couple of
things that I've been wanting to add for a while. Stay tuned.
